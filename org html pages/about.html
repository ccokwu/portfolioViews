						<p>When it comes to styling and dressing up, I do that. When it comes to writing and expressing my inner most feelings and opinons, I do that very well also. And when it comes to showcasing all my talents and adventures as far as amatuer modeling to graphics and so on and so forth, I've got a niche for that too. I started blogging ever since I was 16. The only blog that I can still find from way back when I decided to take it more seriously is The OffBeat Diaries. Writing is something I've always loved doing and at one point, I wanted to be an author. I've written one book and co-written another which I anticipate publishing both in the near future. </p>
						<p>
						Some of the books I've written are as follows:

						<ol>
				 			<li>1. Thought You Were S'posed to Be Tough</li>
				 			<li>2. Complicated</li>
				 		</ol>
				 	</p>
				<p>As for my blog itself, it's not your typical blog. It's not even your typical website. I write and I post for those looking for biased opinons that perhaps pertain to them. I also write and post for those looking for similarities in the interests that I have but cannot find all those things in one place. This is not your typical website and I am not your typical girl. So, with that being said, I hope you sit back and enjoy more of what's to come in this journey of my life and through various interests that you too will find intersting as well because...
